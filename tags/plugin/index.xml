We recently accidentally shipped a version of our plugin that might break your website. Apologising here.
How to recover from a crashing website? Fellow footnotes user @pppierreee pointed out that it would be helpful to give you guidance how to recover:
– Download footnotes 2.5.8 – Unzip – Delete the wp-content/plugins/footnotes/ folder on your webserver – Upload the contents of the unzip (the footnotes folder) to wp-content/plugins/</description></item><item><title>footnotes 2.5.10 reverts 2.5.9d1 and apologies</title><link>https://cheret.tech/2021/03/footnotes-2.5.10-reverts-2.5.9d1-and-apologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 19:02:22 +0100</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.tech/2021/03/footnotes-2.5.10-reverts-2.5.9d1-and-apologies/</guid><description>In the development of the WordPress plugin footnotes, we shipped a broken version that crashed websites for arond four hours starting from 08:37 am.
