I'm a Cyber Security Consultant, Online Content Creator and Exponential Coach. I consistently contribute to international training events run by teams distributed across Europe. My activities range from producing one-week-long academies to managing them on-site or remotely, delivering training, or participating. I have experience in producing more than 300 videos, as well as applying agile methods in getting various startups from the first ideation to profitable operation.
