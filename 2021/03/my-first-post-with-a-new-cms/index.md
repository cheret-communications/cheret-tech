# my first post with a new CMS


## after more than a decade

Just so you know, I've been a [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) **user**, **admin**, and **plugin author** for more than a decade now. I could've set this up as yet another one of those ubiquitous WordPress pages. This time, however, I'm taking a different approach. [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) is my tool of choice as [I'm a DevSecOps Advisor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markcheret), leaning into [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) and of course the automation behind this declarative setup. So here it comes... Yet another steep learning curve for me and a completely new piece of technology to embrace and use. That's the spirit :)

## What's the difference?

WordPress and similar CMSs rely on a database being present and dynamically generate the content every time you browse to a website. This leads to

- slower loading times
- energy spent on dynamically generating pages every time a user visits
- bloated databases keeping the version history and tombstones of plugins no longer used

With HUGO I get to experience the following benefits:

- writing my content in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax (distraction free)
- using the same toolchain I employ for the rest of my cloud computing and developing needs
- the website gets generated into a static version when I push a new revision
- blazingly fast loading times

Regarding **drawbacks** I'm aware that HUGO is intended to be a lightweight solution and doesn't have as many plugins as WordPress, so I need to **downsize** a bit. I take that as an upside as it makes me think about the purpose of the website just that bit harder and the phenomenon called [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) can hopefully be avoided. Another **challenge** is the learning curve to get up to speed with all the options and the completely different approach to publishing.
