What I welcome most about this movement is that it got way easier to rename the default branch on GitHub, which used to be a major PITA.]]></description></item><item><title>First Footnotes Community Meeting</title><link>https://cheret.tech/2021/04/first-footnotes-community-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 21:47:52 +0200</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.tech/2021/04/first-footnotes-community-meeting/</guid><description>On 27/04/2021 we held our first footnotes community meeting.

What we talked about the journey of the footnotes core development team over the past half year, how there was a bit of a rough patch and some storming going on. Now everything is settled and we&amp;rsquo;re bug-fixing and releasing at a sustainable pace.</description></item><item><title>footnotes celebrates its 7th anniversary</title><link>https://cheret.tech/2021/03/footnotes-celebrates-its-7th-anniversary/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.tech/2021/03/footnotes-celebrates-its-7th-anniversary/</guid><description>Happy 7th birthday footnotes the footnotes WordPress plugin is celebrating its 7th anniversary today.

We recently accidentally shipped a version of our plugin that might break your website. Apologising here.
How to recover from a crashing website? Fellow footnotes user @pppierreee pointed out that it would be helpful to give you guidance how to recover:
– Download footnotes 2.5.8 – Unzip – Delete the wp-content/plugins/footnotes/ folder on your webserver – Upload the contents of the unzip (the footnotes folder) to wp-content/plugins/</description></item></channel></rss>
