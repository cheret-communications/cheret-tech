## This page is about the WordPress plugin footnotes and how to receive support

If you're reading these lines, I bet you're using [footnotes](https://cheret.tech/footnotes/) the free WordPress plugin that a team of volunteers provides. It has been under development since 19 March 2014.

As I'm receiving many emails to my personal or company inbox asking for support with this free plugin, I'm letting you know how to actually receive support for the plugin at an appropriate place.

## WordPress.org Support Forum

In many cases, an issue you're having is not unique to you and there are others who could benefit from the discussion or providing a solution. Use the [WordPress.org footnotes support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/footnotes/)

## GitHub Issues

If you're a developer and are finding bugs or want to address security relevant topics with the code, please hop on over to our [GitHub](https://github.com/markcheret/footnotes), clone the repository or [open a GitHub Issue and take a look at the current issues](https://github.com/markcheret/footnotes/issues)
