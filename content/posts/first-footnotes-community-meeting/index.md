On 27/04/2021 we held our first footnotes community meeting. This time it was more or less an internal developer/team meeting and we're opening it up to the public!

## What we talked about

- the journey of the footnotes core development team over the past half year, how there was a bit of a rough patch and some storming going on. Now everything is settled and we're bugfixing and releasing at a sustainable pace.
- the pending 3.0 release which will include a major refactoring of the codebase
- unit tests and testing infrastructure
- to promote the need for participation
- making the community meeting info and the [footnotes GitHub repository](https://github.com/markcheret/footnotes) a part of the plugin's offical readme.txt

## The need for participation

### Who do we need?

- Ambassadors: To promote the plugin and its usefulness for websites of all categories
- Support representatives: To help with troubleshooting and interaction with the community in the forums
- Beta testers: To test development releases against common scenarios
- Developers: To build the automated testing suite (PHP Unit tests) and help with the overall development of the plugin

### Why?

Even though this is a volunteering effort and we're unable to pay anyone in money, you can gain valuable experience in the planning, development, testing and securing of software in general and a niche WordPress plugin in particular. You can gain experience working with a globally distributed team. This is also an additional item in your CV.

### When?

At your earliest convenience. Just [shoot me an email](mailto:mark@cheret.de).

## Next footnotes community meeting

The next meeting will be held on 31/05/2021 at 8pm GMT+02:00 (CET) and all following meetings will be held on the last Monday of the month at the same time. If you want to join, I have set up a [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/jrd-gnqf-aao) and you can [add it to your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MTQzOTc1cXJmZTNqb2RpNmVycTBwaHV0bHFfMjAyMTA1MzFUMTgwMDAwWiBtYXJrQGNoZXJldC5kZQ&tmsrc=mark%40cheret.de&scp=ALL)
