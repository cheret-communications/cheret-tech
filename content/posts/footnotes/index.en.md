## This page is about the WordPress plugin footnotes

It has been under development since 19 March 2014.

**footnotes** aims to be the all-in-one solution for displaying an automatically generated list of references on your Page or Post. The Plugin ships with a set of defaults while also empowering you to control how your footnotes are being displayed.

**footnotes** gives you the ability to display well-formatted footnotes on your WordPress Pages and Posts â€” those footnotes we know from offline publishing.

The plugin has been featured on [wpmudev](http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/12-surprisingly-useful-wordpress-plugins-you-dont-know-about/) --- cheers for the review, folks!

## Footnotes Community Meetings

We recently held our [first footnotes community meeting](https://cheret.tech/2021/04/first-footnotes-community-meeting/) and it's open to the public.

The meetings will be held on the last Monday of each month at 8pm GMT+02:00 (CET). If you want to join, I have set up a [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/jrd-gnqf-aao) and you can [add it to your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MTQzOTc1cXJmZTNqb2RpNmVycTBwaHV0bHFfMjAyMTA1MzFUMTgwMDAwWiBtYXJrQGNoZXJldC5kZQ&tmsrc=mark%40cheret.de&scp=ALL)

## Ongoing call for developers and contributors

We're looking for volunteers to help with the advancement and support of the plugin:

- Ambassadors: To promote the plugin and its usefulness for websites of all categories
- Support representatives: To help with troubleshooting and interaction with the community in the forums
- Beta testers: To test development releases against common scenarios
- Developers: To build the automated testing suite (PHP Unit tests) and help with the overall development of the plugin
