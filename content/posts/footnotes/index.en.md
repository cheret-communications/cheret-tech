## This page is about the WordPress plugin footnotes

It has been under development since 19 March 2014.

**footnotes** aims to be the all-in-one solution for displaying an automatically generated list of references on your Page or Post. The Plugin ships with a set of defaults while also empowering you to control how your footnotes are being displayed.

**footnotes** gives you the ability to display well-formatted footnotes on your WordPress Pages and Posts â€” those footnotes we know from offline publishing.

The plugin has been featured on [wpmudev](http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/12-surprisingly-useful-wordpress-plugins-you-dont-know-about/) --- cheers for the review, folks!
