## What we talked about

- I screen-shared the [First Footnotes Community Meeting Post](2021/04/first-footnotes-community-meeting/) and went through the kind of people we're looking for to further enhance the plugin
- Version 3.0 will be coming soon
- The settings menu will receive a considerable overhaul
- further stability improvements

## Next footnotes community meeting

The next meeting will be held on 31/05/2021 at 8pm GMT+02:00 (CET) and all following meetings will be held on the last Monday of the month at the same time.
